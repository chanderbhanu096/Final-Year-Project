# Overview
“STUDENT ONLINE ATTENDANCE” is application developed for taking the attendance
of the student on the basis of location. First the app will check trough the student smartphone
whether he/she is present within the perimeter of the classroom if he/she is present then the
attendance will be sent as a notification to the teacher application. Each Student will be given
with a separate username and password, where username will be referred as a Roll no... The
message in the notification will be shown in the vertical alignment. This will also help
minimizing the attendance proxy. In most educational institutions the attendance is taken
manually. It is not only time consuming, but it is also unsecure and unreliable and attendance
can be lost. To overcome these problems. I have developed a better system which is Android
Application.
